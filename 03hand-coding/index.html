			<h1>Home</h1>
			<h2>Welcome to GameLibrary</h2>
			<p>
				Here at GameLibrary we want to provide gamers with guides, tutorials,
				and a list of games to consider playing for themselves.
			</p>
			<p>Down below you will find our featured game of the week.</p>
			<h2>Featured Games of the week!</h2>
			<h3>Minecraft</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<a href="games.html#game">Minecraft</a>
					<em>is a game all about exploring</em> a random generated blocky world
					full of different biomes and structures. Players
					<strong>can break the blocks that the world</strong> is made out of to
					dig holes or replace those blocks somewhere else. There is also
					crafting to make different tools and weapons, and a day and night
					cycle featuring monsters that spawn during the night and serve as a
					threat to players who stay outside of shelter.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Roblox</h3>
			<ol start="2">
				<li>
					Roblox is a big website, free to play, with millions of users
					worldwide. It is a MMO designed for all ages allowing its users to
					play games created on the website by other players. Inside these games
					users control a blocky character called a avatar, that can be
					customized with accessories, clothing, different skin color, and other
					items that the user owns in their account. Roblox has a currency
					called Robux that has to be bought with real money, that can be used
					to buy accessories that cost robux in the catalog or gamepasses that
					give owners different items or powerups inside games.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>What are Video games?</h2>
			<p>
				Pretty sure everyone knows this but if not, video games are a form of
				entertainment that involves a program that lets you control a character
				in another world, like in RPGs they let you experience being a knight in
				a medieval world taking on huge monsters and beasts. Also video games
				can be a way to socialize with other people or friends through the
				internet.
